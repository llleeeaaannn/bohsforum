# The Bohs Forum

Plan:
- Find a forum framework that ideally integrates seemlessly with React
- Research cheap hosting
- Research cheap database storage
- Choose a domain name

Options:
- Build from scratch (More time consuming, harder, more impressive, learn more)
- Use a framework (Quicker, easier, learn less, less control)

Features:
Homepage
Different pages for different topics (Bohs, LOI, Other...)
Each page has its own topics which can be created by any users
Each topic is an old school forum post (everything in chronological order)
Replies will be quoted (Show post that is being replied to)

Decision:
Use NodeBB framework but build custom frontend with react and simply call the NodeBB API
