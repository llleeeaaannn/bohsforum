# The Bohs Forum

Plan:
- Find a forum framework that ideally integrates seemlessly with React
- Research cheap hosting
- Research cheap database storage
- Choose a domain name

Options:
- Build from scratch (More time consuming, harder, more impressive, learn more)
- Use a framework (Quicker, easier, learn less, less control)

Forum Framework:
- NodeBB (Free, OpenSource, NodeJS, Modern)
- Discourse (Free, Php/Rails, Modern)
- Flarum (PHP/Java, not very customisable, free)

Current Choice:
NodeBB
